# Unsupervised anomaly detection in network traffic with deep learning
This repository is a file collection comprising my Bachelor Semester Project developed as a "catch-up BSP" for Semester 4 at the University of Luxembourg (July 2024 - August 2024).

The project explores the use of deep learning models for identifying anomalous data in network traffic. Unsupervised anomaly detection in Python is applied to various optimized deep learning models to evaluate their effectiveness, showcasing how machine learning can be utilized to improve network cybersecurity.
